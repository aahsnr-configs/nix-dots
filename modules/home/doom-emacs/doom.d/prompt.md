For the python programming setup section of the my config.org file, I get the following error in the attached screenshots. The error for one screenshot appears when I am typing in jupyter-python org source code blocks. The second screenshot gives me the error when I am editing a .py file. Furthermore, when editing this .py file, ruff is activated as the lsp provided instead basedpyright as it is supposed to. Also disable corfu-popupinfo entirely for corfu since the doom emacs project enables this by default as in the config.el for corfu in https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/modules/completion/corfu/config.el
