Looking at config.el for corfu determine why does corfu-popupinfo--get-documentation and corfu-popupinfo in general need company-doc-buffer. Then determine if there is a way to make company-doc-buffer work. Keep in mind that corfu and company are competing completion systems.

The C-c C-c is bound to jupyter-eval-line-or-region when inside org-edit-special buffer. This keybinding should exit the mentioned buffer when done with coding.

Fix all these issues for me and write the changes needed.
