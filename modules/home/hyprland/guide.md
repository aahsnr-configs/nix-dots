## A Beginner's Guide to Hyprland Keybindings: A Caelestia-Dots Deep Dive

Hyprland's keybindings are one of its most powerful features, offering deep customization. The configuration files from the `caelestia-dots` project are a fantastic real-world example of how to create an efficient and personalized workflow. This guide will break down how these keybindings work, from the basic structure to the more advanced features, and will empower you to start customizing them yourself.

### The Anatomy of a Hyprland Keybinding

In Hyprland, every keybinding follows a simple, consistent structure:

`bind = MODIFIER, KEY, DISPATCHER, ARGUMENT`

Let's break down each part:

- **`bind`**: The command to create a keybinding. As we'll see, there are several variations of this command.
- **`MODIFIER`**: A special key you hold down, like `Super` (the Windows key), `Ctrl`, `Alt`, or `Shift`. You can combine them (e.g., `Super+Shift`).
- **`KEY`**: The regular keyboard key you press (e.g., `T`, `1`, `Space`).
- **`DISPATCHER`**: The action you want to perform. Examples include `exec` (execute a command), `workspace` (change workspace), or `killactive` (close a window).
- **`ARGUMENT`**: The specific instruction for the dispatcher. For `exec`, it's the command to run; for `workspace`, it's the workspace number.

### The Role of `variables.conf`

To keep the main configuration clean and easy to manage, the `caelestia-dots` setup uses a separate file, `hypr/variables.conf`, to define variables. These are essentially shortcuts.

Instead of writing the name of the terminal emulator (`foot`) everywhere, a variable is defined:
`$terminal = foot`

Then, in `keybinds.conf`, this variable is used:
`bind = Super, T, exec, $terminal`

This is incredibly useful. If you ever want to switch your terminal from `foot` to something else, you only need to change it in one place: the `variables.conf` file.

### Understanding the Different `bind` Types

Hyprland provides several variations of the `bind` command to control _how_ and _when_ a key press is registered. The `caelestia-dots` configuration uses these smartly.

| Command     | Name            | How it Works                                          | Caelestia-Dots Example                                                                       |
| :---------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`bind`**  | Standard        | Triggers the action immediately on key press.         | `bind = Super, T, exec, $terminal` (Opens terminal instantly)                                |
| **`bindl`** | Lock / Latching | Triggers the action when you _release_ the key.       | `bindl = , XF86MonBrightnessUp, exec, brightnessctl set +5%` (Adjusts brightness on release) |
| **`bindr`** | Release         | Similar to `bindl`, triggers on key release.          | `bindr = Ctrl+Super+Shift, R, exec, kill-process` (Executes on release)                      |
| **`binde`** | Repeat          | The action repeats as long as you hold the keys down. | `binde = Super, Page_Up, workspace, -1` (Continuously cycles workspaces)                     |
| **`bindm`** | Mouse           | Binds mouse buttons instead of keyboard keys.         | `bindm = Super, mouse:272, movewindow` (Hold Super and drag to move windows)                 |

#### Special Caelestia Binds: `bindi` and `bindin`

You will also notice `bindi` and `bindin` in the configuration. These are **not** standard Hyprland commands but are part of this specific dotfiles setup to achieve a "tap-or-hold" function for the Super key.

- `bindi = Super, Super_L, global, caelestia:launcher`: This means if you tap (press and release) the Super key by itself, it runs the application launcher.
- `bindin = Super, catchall, global, caelestia:launcherInterrupt`: This interrupts the launcher command if you hold Super and press another key. This is what allows you to use `Super` as a modifier for other shortcuts (like `Super+T`) without accidentally opening the launcher every time.

### Submaps: Creating Keybinding "Modes"

Submaps are an advanced Hyprland feature for creating different "layers" or "modes" of keybindings. When you enter a submap, a completely different set of keybindings becomes active.

In `keybinds.conf`, you see these lines at the top:

```ini
exec = hyprctl dispatch submap global
submap = global
```

- **`submap = global`**: This declares the start of a submap named "global". All the keybindings that follow this line belong to this submap.
- **`exec = hyprctl dispatch submap global`**: This command, executed when the configuration loads, tells Hyprland to immediately enter and activate the "global" submap. This ensures all your primary keybindings are active from the start.

### A Guided Tour of `keybinds.conf`

Now, let's look at how these concepts are applied in the `caelestia-dots` configuration.

#### Application Launchers

These bindings are for opening your most-used applications.

- **Launcher**: Tap `Super` to open the main application launcher.
- **Terminal**: `Super + T` opens the terminal (`$terminal`).
- **Browser**: `Super + W` opens the web browser (`$browser`).
- **Code Editor**: `Super + C` opens the code editor (`$editor`).
- **File Explorer**: `Super + E` opens the file explorer (`$fileExplorer`).

#### Workspace and Window Management

These bindings are the core of navigating the tiling window manager.

- **Switch Workspaces**: `Super + [1-9, 0]` switches to the corresponding workspace.
- **Move Window to Workspace**: `Super + Alt + [1-9, 0]` moves the currently focused window to that workspace.
- **Cycle Workspaces**: `Super + Page_Up/Page_Down` or `Super + Mouse Wheel` cycles through workspaces. This uses `binde` for a fast, repeating action.
- **Change Window Focus**: `Super + [Arrow Keys]` changes focus between windows.
- **Move Window Position**: `Super + Shift + [Arrow Keys]` moves the focused window around in the layout.
- **Close Window**: `Super + Q` closes the active window (`killactive`).
- **Toggle Floating**: `Super + Alt + Space` toggles a window between being tiled and floating.
- **Fullscreen**: `Super + F` makes the active window fullscreen.
- **Move/Resize with Mouse**: `Super + Left Mouse Drag` moves a window, and `Super + Right Mouse Drag` resizes it. This uses the `bindm` command.

#### Utilities

These are helpful bindings for system functions and tools.

- **Screenshots**: `Print Screen` takes a fullscreen screenshot, while `Super + Shift + S` lets you select a region.
- **Screen Recording**: `Super + Alt + R` starts and stops a screen recording.
- **Volume Control**: The dedicated volume keys (`XF86AudioMute`, etc.) are used. They are bound with `binde` or `bindl` so the action repeats if held or triggers on release.
- **Brightness Control**: The dedicated brightness keys (`XF86MonBrightnessUp`, etc.) work similarly to the volume keys.
- **Clipboard Manager**: `Super + V` opens a clipboard history.
- **Emoji Picker**: `Super + .` opens an emoji selector.
- **Lock Screen**: `Super + L` locks your session.

### Going Further: Customizing Your Own Keybinds

Now that you understand how the `caelestia-dots` keybindings work, you can tailor them to your own needs. Hereâ€™s what you need to know to start creating and modifying keybinds safely.

#### 1. Exploring More Dispatchers and Arguments

The `DISPATCHER` is the core action of your keybind. While `exec` and `workspace` are common, Hyprland has many more.

| Dispatcher        | Action                                                       | Example Argument(s)                                    |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `killactive`      | Closes the currently focused window.                         | (none)                                                 |
| `togglefloating`  | Toggles the focused window between tiling and floating mode. | (none)                                                 |
| `fullscreen`      | Toggles fullscreen for the active window.                    | `0` (Standard), `1` (Maximized), `2` (Fake Fullscreen) |
| `movefocus`       | Moves the focus to another window.                           | `l` (left), `r` (right), `u` (up), `d` (down)          |
| `movewindow`      | Moves the active window's position in the layout.            | `l`, `r`, `u`, `d`                                     |
| `resizeactive`    | Resizes the active window.                                   | `10 0` (expand 10px right), `-10 0` (shrink 10px left) |
| `cyclenext`       | Cycles focus to the next window in the workspace.            | (none)                                                 |
| `movetoworkspace` | Moves the active window to a specific workspace.             | `3` (to workspace 3), `+1` (to next workspace)         |

#### 2. How to Find Key Names

To bind a key, you must know what Hyprland calls it. You can find key names with a tool called `wev` (Wayland Event Viewer).

1.  **Install it:** `wev` should be in your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo pacman -S wev`).
2.  **Run it:** Open a terminal and run `wev`.
3.  **Press the key:** A small window will appear. Click it, then press the key you want to identify. The terminal output will show a `sym` value. That is the key's name.

For example, pressing the volume up key might show:
`sym: XF86AudioRaiseVolume (60292), utf8: ''`
The name you need for your config is `XF86AudioRaiseVolume`.

#### 3. Practical Example: Creating a Resize Submap

Let's create a "resize mode" that you can enter and exit.

**Goal:** Press `Super + R` to enter a mode where the arrow keys resize the active window. Press `Escape` to return to normal.

Add this code to your `keybinds.conf`:

```ini
# Bind to enter the resize submap
bind = Super, R, submap, resize

# --- START of resize submap ---
submap = resize

# Binds that are active ONLY inside this submap
binde = , left, resizeactive, -20 0
binde = , right, resizeactive, 20 0
binde = , up, resizeactive, 0 -20
binde = , down, resizeactive, 0 20

# Bind to exit the submap and return to global mode
bind = , escape, submap, reset

# --- END of resize submap ---
```

**How it works:**

1.  Pressing `Super + R` activates the `resize` submap, disabling your normal keybinds.
2.  Now, the arrow keys resize the window. We use `binde` so you can hold them down.
3.  When done, `Escape` triggers `submap, reset`, deactivating the submap and re-enabling your `global` keybindings.

#### 4. Final Tips for Safe Customization

- **Backup First:** Always make a copy of your configuration files before editing.
- **Reload, Don't Restart:** After saving a change, reload Hyprland by running `hyprctl reload` in a terminal.
- **Add Comments:** Use the `#` symbol to leave notes in your config for your future self.
- **One Change at a Time:** Make one change, save, and reload. This makes it much easier to find the source of a problem if one occurs.
