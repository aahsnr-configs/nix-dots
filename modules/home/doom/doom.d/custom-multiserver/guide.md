Let me search for more specific information about how lsp-bridge selects multiserver configurations automatically.Based on my search results, I can now answer your question with clarity:

**Yes, lsp-bridge WILL automatically detect JSON files in `lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir` without needing `lsp-bridge-get-multi-lang-server-by-project`**, but there's an important selection hierarchy to understand.

## How lsp-bridge Selects Multiserver Configurations

lsp-bridge follows a specific order when selecting which server to use:

1. First, it tries `lsp-bridge-get-multi-lang-server-by-project` (custom function)
2. Then it checks `lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-extension-list` (file extension based)
3. Finally it checks `lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-mode-list` (major-mode based)

If no multiserver configuration is found, lsp-bridge falls back to checking single-server configurations using `lsp-bridge-get-single-lang-server-by-project`, file extension list, and mode list.

## Two Ways to Use Multiserver Without Custom Functions

**Option 1: Use `lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-extension-list`**

This variable maps file extensions to multiserver configuration names. For example, when opening a `*.vue` file, lsp-bridge will automatically use `volar_emmet` to utilize both volar and emmet-ls.

**Option 2: Use `lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-mode-list`**

This maps Emacs major-modes to multiserver configurations.

Let me update the configuration to show both approaches:Perfect! I've updated the configuration to show all three options clearly. Here's what you need to know:

## Answer to Your Question

**YES**, when you set `lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir`, lsp-bridge WILL automatically detect and use the `.json` files in that directory, **BUT** you need to tell lsp-bridge which multiserver configuration to use for each language. You have 3 options:

### Recommended Approach (Simplest)

Use **`lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-extension-list`** to map file extensions to your multiserver JSON files. This is the cleanest approach:

```elisp
(setq lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-extension-list
      '((("py") . "basedpyright_ruff")
        (("ts" "tsx") . "tsserver_eslint")))
```

When you place `basedpyright_ruff.json` and `tsserver_eslint.json` in your `lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir`, lsp-bridge will:
1. See the file extension (e.g., `.py`)
2. Look up the configuration name (`"basedpyright_ruff"`)
3. First check `~/.config/doom/lsp-bridge/multiserver/basedpyright_ruff.json`
4. Fall back to the built-in configuration if not found

The user directory configurations will override the default ones if the filenames match.

So you **don't need** `lsp-bridge-get-multi-lang-server-by-project` unless you want dynamic, project-specific logic (like choosing different servers based on project path or file content).
