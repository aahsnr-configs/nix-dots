Of course. Your new configuration is an excellent evolution, moving from a custom function-based approach for `TAB` to a more robust and idiomatic setup using Emacs's built-in `tab-always-indent`. This requires a slightly different testing plan, especially for the TAB key's behavior.

Here is the updated, step-by-step plan to verify every component of your new completion framework.

### Pre-flight Check: Load and Verify

First, ensure the new configuration loads without issues.

1.  Restart your Emacs daemon/client.
2.  Check the `*Messages*` buffer for any startup errors. If you see anything related to `corfu`, `orderless`, `vertico`, etc., address those first. With a clean startup, you can proceed.

---

### Test 1: The Core Manual UI (Vertico + Orderless)

**Goal:** Confirm Vertico is your main UI and Orderless provides flexible filtering.

1.  Press `M-x` (or `SPC SPC`).
2.  **Expected Outcome:** A **vertical** list of commands appears in the minibuffer. This confirms **Vertico** is active.
3.  At the prompt, type `buff sw` (out of order).
4.  **Expected Outcome:** `switch-to-buffer` is listed as a candidate. This confirms **Orderless** is providing flexible, out-of-order matching for manual completion.

### Test 2: The Annotations (Marginalia + Nerd Icons)

**Goal:** Ensure candidates are enriched with descriptions and icons.

1.  Press `M-x`.
2.  **Expected Outcome:** To the right of each command, a short description appears. This confirms **Marginalia** is working.
3.  Run `find-file` (`C-x C-f`).
4.  **Expected Outcome:** In the file list, icons appear to the left of each file and directory. This confirms **nerd-icons-completion** is working.

### Test 3: The Automatic UI (Corfu + Nerd Icons)

**Goal:** Verify the automatic in-buffer completion popup.

1.  Go to the `*scratch*` buffer.
2.  On a new line, slowly type `(setq com`.
3.  **Expected Outcome:** A popup menu appears beside your cursor with candidates. This confirms **Corfu** is working. In the left margin of the popup, you should see small icons. This confirms **nerd-icons-corfu** is working.

### Test 4: The New Smart TAB Behavior (Crucial Test)

**Goal:** Test the new, built-in `tab-always-indent` logic and Corfu's integration with it.

1.  **Test Indentation:** Go to a new line in the `*scratch*` buffer. Press `TAB`.
2.  **Expected Outcome:** The line should indent by two spaces. This confirms `tab-always-indent` is correctly prioritizing indentation.

3.  **Test Completion Trigger:** Press `TAB` again on the same, now-indented line.
4.  **Expected Outcome:** Nothing should happen, because there is no symbol to complete. Now, type `comple`. The Corfu popup should appear automatically. This confirms that `TAB` correctly attempts completion _after_ the line is indented.

5.  **Test Cycling (`completion-cycle-threshold`):** We need to create a scenario with 3 or fewer candidates.
    - In the `*scratch*` buffer, define two unique variables:
      ```elisp
      (defvar my-test-variable-alpha 1)
      (defvar my-test-variable-beta 2)
      ```
    - Evaluate them (press `C-j` on each line).
    - On a new line, type `my-test-v`. The Corfu popup should appear with only two candidates.
    - Press `TAB`.
6.  **Expected Outcome:** The selection in the popup should cycle forward between `my-test-variable-alpha` and `my-test-variable-beta`. This confirms that **`completion-cycle-threshold` is working** and your `corfu-map` bindings are correct.

7.  **Test Backward Cycling:** With the same popup visible, press `S-TAB` (Shift+TAB).
8.  **Expected Outcome:** The selection should cycle backward.

9.  **Test Mode Exclusion:** Run `M-x vterm`. Try typing a command like `ls -`.
10. **Expected Outcome:** No Corfu popup should appear. This confirms your `ar/corfu-disabled-modes` list is working correctly.

### Test 5: Superpowers (Consult Previews & Embark Actions)

**Goal:** Check that Consult and Embark are fully integrated.

1.  Switch buffers with `C-x b`.
2.  **Expected Outcome:** A `consult-buffer` prompt appears. As you navigate the list, a **live preview** of each buffer is shown. This confirms **Consult's** preview system is active.
3.  With the list open, highlight a buffer and press `C-.` (`embark-act`).
4.  **Expected Outcome:** An `*Embark Actions*` prompt appears with relevant actions (e.g., `Kill Buffer`). This confirms **Embark** is working.
5.  With the Embark actions visible, press `e` to export.
6.  **Expected Outcome:** A new `*Embark Collect Live*` buffer is created with the list of buffers. This confirms the **Embark-Consult** integration.

### Test 6: The Completion Backends (Cape + Dabbrev)

**Goal:** Ensure `cape` is providing extra completion sources.

1.  In the `*scratch*` buffer, type the word `zimbabwe` on a line.
2.  On a new line, type `zim`.
3.  **Expected Outcome:** The Corfu popup should appear, offering `zimbabwe` as a candidate (likely annotated with "dabbrev"). This confirms **Cape** has successfully added the `cape-dabbrev` backend.
4.  Now, test your dedicated binding. Erase the line, type `zim` again and press `M-/`.
5.  **Expected Outcome:** It should complete to `zimbabwe`. This confirms your `dabbrev` keybinding is working independently.

If you have passed all these tests, your new, more robust completion framework is fully operational and correctly configured. The main improvement is that the `TAB` key's behavior is now more predictable and less likely to cause conflicts.
