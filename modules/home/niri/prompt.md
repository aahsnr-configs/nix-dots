For the attached danksearch.nix file, fix the error in the attached screenshot. Then only use the `inputs.dsearch.packages.${pkgs.system}.default` as the package. Then find and fix any errors and issues withing the scripts in this file as well. Also find and fix any errors and issues within the systemd files as well. Furthermore determine if there are any errors and issues in home.packages itself like `cfg.package` which I don't recongnize. Search the web before writing anything.
