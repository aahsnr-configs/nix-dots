Sourche the scripts module in `default.nix` home-manager module in the `keybindings.nix` module for Hyprland. And then implement the `wsaction` fish script in the keybindings section where `wsaction` is mentioned, but use best nix and home-manager practices to use this script. Do not change anything for the keybindings settings. I want this script's destionation be in nix stores like how nixpkgs themselves are installed and refer to the script like how nixpkgs are called in this scenario. Also update any keybindings that mention nixpkgs include caelestia to use the proper method to call these packages. Make these changes and then rewrite the whole keybindings.nix module with the changes. Make sure to search the guide you in adapting this keybindings.nix module, as well as search popular nixos configurations that run Hyprland and how they implement the above scenario

For the default.nix containing many scripts remove any scripts that start `arch-` since these scripts are not needed in NixOS
